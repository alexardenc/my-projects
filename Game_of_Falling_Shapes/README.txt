3. Read the instructions given and click start to begin. Press 'l' to move right, 'j' to move left,
'1' to shoot triangle, '2' to shoot circle, and '3' to shoot square. Note that the keyPressed() function
often stops working for Mac OS after several button presses. The program works correctly on Ethan's
Windows 10 computer.

4. To win, correctly match the bullets with the shapes 25 times. You will be presented with a "You Win"
screen upon doing so, with the option to restart. To lose, your health must drop below one. You lose
health when you shoot a shape with an incorrect bullet. You will be presented with a "You Failed"
screen upon doing so, with the option to restart.
