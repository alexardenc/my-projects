group_KAE_finalprojectProgressReport.pde README

Follow the steps below to run the program:
1. Click on the file group_KAE_finalprojectProgressReport.pde to open it.

2. Press the play button.

3. Use the mouse to click on any of the main menu buttons. The "How to Play" button
will take you to the Instructions screen.

4. Click "Start" to begin the game. Note that the beat timer, enemy movement, and board
color changes begin at the first user input of any of the keys listed in the instructions.
Because of this, is important to begin on the downbeat of the music. (NOTE: Since it is difficult
to find the exact length in milliseconds of each beat interval, the music and beat timer
sometimes go out of sync slightly. The user is given the opportunity to reset the beat every
64 downbeats if they are losing health despite giving inputs on the correct beat.)
