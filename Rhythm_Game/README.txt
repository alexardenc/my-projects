Note: The program may not run correctly when the user is using bluetooth headphones.
Also, this is a tempo based game. The tempo selected for the song is as close to correct as we could make it. However, the timer may occasionally become out of sync with the song, and is not always consistent in how long it remains on beat during the game. We provided a spacebar reset button if the timer gets off beat during the song. It would be best to use it as soon as it becomes available, rather than wait for the timer to get out of sync; but it may not become necessary immediately.
